My name is Mohammad (Persian: محمد‎; pronounced [mo-ham-mad]). I'm from [Bojnord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojnord) and currently live in [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran). I was born in May 31th in 1996. I study computer science and my main research field is Cryptography and Complexity Theory along with mathematical foundations of Cryptography like algebra. I am also interested in low level programming and security stuff. I worked in many tech companies as Infrastructure engineer or DevOps. I am a newbie photographer and I am really interested in music and wish to learn Flute one day! I am also a former member of my college basketball team but currently I am concentrating on my Taekwondo training. Feel free to contact me!
