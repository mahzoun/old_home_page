He was wise and brave. As a teacher of young students all of whom were careless about life and passion, he taught us one, important lesson. It was a sunny day and we were sitting in his class, he picked the marker and wrote a word on the board. The word was “عشق”. “This is the only time during your whole education that you will see this word on the board!”, He said. Then he talked about the most important dimensions of human life and asked us to be wise in our life. He told us about “The little prince” and many other precious heritages from great people all of which was a “candle” to enlighten our path through our lives. Now it’s been about 15 years that I am a student and I have been participating in many many classes. After all these years, I found that he was right! I never saw that word on the board of my classes again. That was the last time. And now, I believe I will never see that word again (at least as a student). It’s about 9 years and I have never forgot what he taught me. And currently, at the most unstable phase of my life, I don’t afraid because I know what is more important than my achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. It’s been a while since my last blog writing.  &lt;br /&gt;
PPS. Wasn’t it a little bit short? I will write more next time.    &lt;br /&gt;
PPPS. Tomorrow will be better than today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;profile.png&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Computer Science Student&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Tehran/Iran&quot;, &quot;employer&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;googlescholar&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m_p68MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;mohammad.mahzoun@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://mahzoun.me&quot;, &quot;bitbucket&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;codepen&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;dribbble&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;flickr&quot;=&gt;&quot;photos/mahzoun&quot;, &quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;mmahzoun&quot;, &quot;foursquare&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;&quot;mahzoun&quot;, &quot;google_plus&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;keybase&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;instagram&quot;=&gt;&quot;mohammad.mahzoun&quot;, &quot;lastfm&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;linkedin&quot;=&gt;&quot;mohammadmahzoun&quot;, &quot;orcid&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;pinterest&quot;=&gt;&quot;mohammadmahzoun&quot;, &quot;soundcloud&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;stackoverflow&quot;=&gt;&quot;4786752/mohammad-mahzoun&quot;, &quot;steam&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;tumblr&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;mmahzoun&quot;, &quot;vine&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;weibo&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;xing&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;youtube&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;wikipedia&quot;=&gt;nil}</name><email>mohammad.mahzoun@gmail.com</email><uri>https://mahzoun.me</uri></author><category term="memories" /><category term="rise" /><summary type="html">I had a literature teacher when I was 13 whose name was Mr. Houshmand.
